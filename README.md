# Projections_eigen_PCA
### Principal component analysis is an useful technique for understanding the dimensions but may be applied with caution in certain settings where feature interpretability is a concern
### It tries to project the features in a subspace consisting of eigen basis vectors which is a linear combination of all the features. orthogonal vectors are defined which tries to explain variances in the data.
